# Requirement-Engineering-Project-
Completed the requirement gathering process for a COVID tracking device, covering the goals of social interaction, risk assessment, notifying users, and travel suggestions after assessing the risk.

The goals of the project were the following: 

• To design a mobile-based, interactive system that effortlessly and reliably monitors 
citizens travel locations, social interaction touch points and updates an individual risk 
profile. 

• To develop mechanisms that allow users to receive notifications when the individual risk 
levels go beyond particular threshold. 

• To develop a mechanism that allow users to check the risk level of a social event or 
location before travelling to that place.
